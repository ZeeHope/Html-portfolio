 <hr/>
 <h3>The Doctors</h3>
 <p>The Doctors K-drama tells a story about a young girl staying with her grandmom after her parents died in a car accident. She experienced unfairness and thanks to her Teakwondo lessons since her childhood, she was able to fight for herself. She met a math teacher who was sent to teach in a high school as a form of introspection. The teacher was a great inspiration to this girl. Then they formed a bond which was more than that of a teacher and the student, but they didn't pursue it. She graduated and went to a medical school, completed her studies and community service etc, and got to work at the big hospital. She became famous in that hospital as she was competent. Somehow that 'doctor-teacher' at her previous school was reistated and worked at the same hospital as her. The love story bloom  between them. This drama is very inspirational, I loved it a lot. </p>
<h3>True Beauty</h3>
<p>This one is about the girl who was struggling at school because of the beauty standards at her school. Hence she was trying with all her means to meet the demands as she was also getting bullied. Through her journey, she found herself getting attention of two famous, most handsome boys at school who happened to be friends, and that was when the swoonworthy love triangle started. It worth being added on your watchlist, if you like high school rom-com.</p>
